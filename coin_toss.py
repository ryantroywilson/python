"""
Write a function that simulates tossing a coin 5,000 times. Your function should print how many times the head/tail 
appears.

Sample output should be like the following:

Starting the program...
Attempt #1: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 1 head(s) so far and 0 tail(s) so far
Attempt #2: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 2 head(s) so far and 0 tail(s) so far
Attempt #3: Throwing a coin... It's a tail! ... Got 2 head(s) so far and 1 tail(s) so far
Attempt #4: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 3 head(s) so far and 1 tail(s) so far
...
Attempt #5000: Throwing a coin... It's a head! ... Got 2412 head(s) so far and 2588 tail(s) so far
Ending the program, thank you!
Hint: Use the python built-in round function to convert that floating point number into an integer

x = .23945593
y = .798839238
x_rounded = round(x)
# x_rounded will be rounded down to 0
y_rounded = round(y)
# y_rounded will be rounded up to 1
