'''
Odd/Even:
Create a function called odd_even that counts from 1 to 2000. 
As your loop executes have your program print the number of that iteration
and specify whether it's an odd or even number.
'''
def odd_even():
    for x in range(1,2001):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            print "Number is",x, "This is an even number."
        else:
            print "Number is",x, "This is an odd Number"

odd_even()

'''
Multiply:
Create a function called 'multiply' that iterates through each value 
in a list (e.g. a = [2, 4, 10, 16]) and returns a list where each value 
has been multiplied by 5.
'''
def multiply(arr, num):
    for x in range(0, len(arr)):
        arr[x] *= num
    return arr
numbers_array = [3,6,8,10,67]
print multiply(numbers_array, 5)
